      If only we could all have friends like %{name}. You've been invited to try out a tool called Hello Bar. It allows you to convert more of your website visitors into customers, it grows your following, and it does a bunch of other things for your site.

      If you want to try it, you can get it below. Once you install Hello Bar, both you and your friend will enjoy a free month of Hello Bar %{pro_or_growth}. (There's also a free version.)
    flash:
      created: We've sent an invite to your friend. Check back here to see whether they've accepted it and redeem any free months.
      already_exists: Sorry, but this person is already using HelloBar.
      not_created: Sorry, but there was a problem while sending this invite. (%{error})
      saved: Saved!
      not_saved: Sorry, but there was a problem saving your change.
      accepted: Success! Your discount will be applied after you create your first site and install the Hello Bar script.
