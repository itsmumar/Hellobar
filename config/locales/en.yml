# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      If only we could all have friends like %{name}. You've been invited to try out a tool called Hello Bar. It allows you to convert more of your website visitors into customers, it grows your following, and it does a bunch of other things for your site.

      If you want to try it, you can get it below. Once you install Hello Bar, both you and your friend will enjoy a free month of Hello Bar Pro. (There's also a free version.)
