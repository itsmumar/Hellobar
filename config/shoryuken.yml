# don't forget to update cache_store's `pool_size` option and `pool` option in `database.yml`
# if you go with the `concurrency` option *above* the value set in `database.yml` and
# `config/environments/*.rb` (`cache_store` setting)

# `concurrency` setting sets the number of threads Shoryuken will spawn to process SQS jobs
concurrency: 3

# `delay` setting means how many seconds Shoryuken will wait for querying the SQS queue for
# jobs (happens when the queue will be empty); Setting it to a higher value makes it more
# cost effective at AWS as they charge per each query
delay: 3
