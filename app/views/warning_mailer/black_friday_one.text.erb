Oooh you’re halfway there… to the 5,000 view Starter Plan limit, that is!

Your site <%= @site.url %> has now reached 2,500 views and counting.

If you do reach 5,000 views before the end of the month, our system will temporarily deactivate your pop-ups until December 1st</b>, when your view count will reset and your pop-ups will be set back to live once again.

That being said, I want to be sure you know exactly what that means in terms of sales, because we are headed into the absolute most important time of the year for sales on your website.

Last year, a record breaking $19.62 billion was spent over the stretch from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday in the U.S. alone.</b>

I want to be sure you have your pop-ups up and running on your site so that you can kick back and enjoy pumpkin pie, while grabbing your piece of this money pie this Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

So, let’s be sure you are ready for the highest sales period ALL year.

As a special sneak peek to be sure you are ready for this super important sales holiday, I am releasing our Cyber Monday deal early so you can save right now.
