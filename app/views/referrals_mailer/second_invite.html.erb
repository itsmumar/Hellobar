<p>Hi,</p>

<p>
  This is a friendly heads-up that the invitation to
  you from your buddy <%= @referral.sender.name %> is about to expire.
</p>

<p>
  The invitation allows you to get what other people pay money for -- the ability to use Hello Bar Pro for one month free.
  <br>
  Hello Bar shows the right message at the right time to your website visitors.
  That means more signups, and more profit.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to try it, you can get it below.
  Once you install Hello Bar, both you and your friend will enjoy a free month of Hello Bar Pro.
  (There's also a free version.)
</p>

<p>
  <a href="<%= @referral.url %>"><%= @referral.url %></a>
</p>

<p>P.S. This invitation expires on <%= @referral.expiration_date_string %>.</p>
