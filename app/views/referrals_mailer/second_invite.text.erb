Hi,

This is a friendly heads-up that the invitation to you from your buddy <%= @referral.sender.name %> is about to expire. The invitation allows you to get what other people pay money for -- the ability to use Hello Bar Pro for one month free.

Hello Bar shows the right message at the right time to your website visitors. That means more signups, and more profit.

If you want to try it, you can get it below. Once you install Hello Bar, both you and your friend will enjoy a free month of Hello Bar Pro. (There's also a free version.)

<%= @referral.url %>

P.S. This invitation expires on <%= @referral.expiration_date_string %>.
