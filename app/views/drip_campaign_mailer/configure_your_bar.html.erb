        We noticed you were in the
        dashboard recently and didn't quite finish the process of configuring your first
        Hello Bar.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's a powerful tool and we have built in many customization
        options on purpose. That sometimes means that the first Bar can seem a little
        overwhelming.
      </p>

      <p>
        In our experience with over 100,000 users, the key thing is
        just to start with a simple bar that uses a default style and maybe just delivers
        an announcement to your website visitors.
        <br>Once you see the bar up and running,
        no doubt you'll have ideas about different messages to try, different placements
        of the bar on your page, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just remember that
        <b>you don't need to make all those detailed customization decisions right
          away.</b>
        <br>You've done good work to have come this far with Hello Bar.
        <br>So when you
        have a spare couple of minutes, we suggest you <b>get a simple, bare-bones bar</b>
        up and working for you.
