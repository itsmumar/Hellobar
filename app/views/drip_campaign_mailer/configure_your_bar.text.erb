We noticed you were in the dashboard recently and didn't quite finish the process of configuring your first Hello Bar.

It's a powerful tool and we have built in many customization options on purpose. That sometimes means that the first Bar can seem a little overwhelming.

In our experience with over 100,000 users, the key thing is just to start with a simple bar that uses a default style and maybe just delivers an announcement to your website visitors.

Once you see the bar up and running, no doubt you'll have ideas about different messages to try, different placements of the bar on your page, and so on.

Just remember that you don't need to make all those detailed customization decisions right away. You've done good work to have come this far with Hello Bar. So when you have a spare couple of minutes, we suggest you get a simple, bare-bones bar up and working for you.
