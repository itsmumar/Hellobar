We just noticed that you were in the process of setting up your first Hello Bar but that process is not finished.

Here's the good stuff that's in store for you just minutes from now, after you finish setting up Hello Bar:You'll be able to get your visitors' attention more easily the moment they land on your site.Then you'll gather more email addresses with Hello Bar because it's visible but not annoying.Hello Bar will enable you to make announcements about special offers or pages you want people to focus on.You can also use Hello Bar to make sure people know about deadlines coming up.

Oh, and you'll get all of this for free.

It's easy to log back in and pick it up where you left off.

We look forward to hearing soon about how Hello Bar supports your website goals.
