Hi,

You have exceeded your monthly view limit on <%= @site.url %>. Your current plan allows for <%= @limit %> views per month and your site is currently over <%= @number_of_views %>.

Your pop-ups are all still showing as they normally would but you will now be charged $5 for each additional 25,000 views they get until the end of this month. Your view count allowance will reset to zero on the 1st day of next month.

Your other option is to upgrade to our <a href="https://app.hellobar.com/profile#pricing-elite">Elite Plan</a> which gives you 500,000 views plus lots of other cool features. Upgrading before the end of the month will erase any of your accruing overage fees too!

If you have any questions, just reply to <a href="mailto:support@hellobar.com">support@hellobar.com</a> and weâ€™ll get back to you asap!

Thanks for using Hello Bar!
