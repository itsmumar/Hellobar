Hi


You have exceeded your monthly view limit on <%= @site.url %>. Your current plan allows for <%= @limit %> views per month and your site is currently over <%= @number_of_views %>.

Your site elements are all still active and you will now be charged $5 for each additional 25,000 views (if you're on a Growth plan) or $5 for each 100,000 (if you're on an Elite plan) during this billing cycle.

If you're on our Growth plan, your other option is to upgrade to our <a href="https://app.hellobar.com/profile#pricing-elite">Elite Plan</a> which gives you 500,000 views plus lots of other cool features.

If you are an Elite plan user and anticipate going over this limit regularly you should reach out to us directly and we can discuss a custom plan for you! Just reply to <a href="mailto:support@hellobar.com">support@hellobar.com</a> and weâ€™ll get back to you asap!

Thanks for using Hello Bar
