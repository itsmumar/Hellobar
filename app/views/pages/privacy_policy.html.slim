        li Other Information We Receive and Store: When you register to use Hello Bar, we store “cookies,” which are strings of code, on your computer.

        li Tracking Our Emails to Our Customers: When we send emails to our own registered Hello Bar customers, we’ll sometimes track who opened the emails and who went so far as to click on any of the hyperlinks. We do this to measure the performance of our Campaigns, and to improve our offerings to specific customer segments.
        li Information From Other Sources: We may obtain additional information about you by using your email address, or other information, to directly, or through one or more services, search over the internet, or elsewhere.

There are purposes, other than marketing, for which we are not willing or able to treat information of any open account differently from that of any other open account. Therefore, if you object to changes in our Privacy Policy which relate to those purposes, we will have to terminate your account.
