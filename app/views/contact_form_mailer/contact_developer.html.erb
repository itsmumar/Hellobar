<p>
  I just created a Hello Bar for <%= @site_url %> and
  I've asked Hello Bar to email you the instructions for installing it.
</p>
<p>
  All you need to do is add the following bit of JavaScript
  at the end of each page (right before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag):
</p>

<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="<%= @script_url %>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>
  If you have any questions don't hesitate to email Hello Bar support at support@hellobar.com,
  or e-mail me at <%= @user_email %>.
</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
