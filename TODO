== Questions ==
1. Do RuleSets make sense as a concept?
  class RuleSet < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :rules
  end

  class Bar < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :rule_set
  end
2. How do we backfill so we can, in theory, regenerate scripts for every site?
  - Goal#id and its relationships now that we have Rule
    - Column to hold old Goal#id and we just offset the ID by some value?
  - Cast all serialized attributes into a structured form
3. What to do about the script assuming each goal has a 'type' when that is now on Goal
   but rules having multiple goals? Maybe this is a deprecated field we add to Rule?
4. Double check Goal / Rule have a hardcoded priority of 1
5. Should we use the defaults found in Bar.rb for BarSetting default values?

== TODO ==
1. Support pausing bars
2. Ensure script handles all original options
  - render_paused_bars
  - disable_eligibility
  - bar_id
